## Technologies
The frontend was developed with React Native and we leveraged Google Maps API to locate nearby shelters. The backend was built with Node.js and Firebase.

## Inspiration
A portmanteau of the words "she", "share", and "charity", Sharity is a donation app focused on providing women with necessities. Sharity promotes women empowerment in the community and sustainability by encouraging users to donate their used or new items to local female’s shelters.

## What it does
On the user side, Sharity allows users to connect to women shelters and donate clothing articles and personal hygiene products. They can take pictures of their items, upload them to the app, and donate to selected organizations. Users can search local shelters on the built-in maps function, and can view each shelter’s donation wishlist. Users also have access to the Period Positivity fundraiser, where funds go towards purchasing personal hygiene products for local Vancouver organizations.

On the charities' side, organizations can swipe left to decline and right to accept donation items offered by the community, and edit their preferences and donation wishlist. They are also able to chat with users about donation pickup/drop-off information.
